RBEIS implementations using Pandas and PySpark for SML

---

Our tests make use of Lemus and Stam's _Art History Textbook Data_ dataset, for which we are grateful to the authors for publishing and to [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-17) for publicising.  We have included the original dataset at `tests/artists_original.csv`, a modified version at `tests/artists_unique.csv` and the same modified version with some data removed (for the purpose of testing imputation) at `tests/artists_unique_missing.csv`.
