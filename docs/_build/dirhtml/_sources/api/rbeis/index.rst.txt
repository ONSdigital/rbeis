.. py:module:: rbeis

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   RBEIS is a method originally developed for imputing categorical data in relatively small social surveys with the intention of minimising conditional imputation variance. It is derived from CANCEIS, which is better suited to large datasets such as the Census.  This implementation of RBEIS works with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) DataFrames.

   rbeis.RBEISDistanceFunction




.. py:exception:: RBEISInputException

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`

   Exception raised in the case of faulty input to `impute` that is not covered by a TypeError.
.. py:exception:: RBEISInputWarning

   Bases: :py:obj:`UserWarning`

   Warning raised in the case of redundant input to `impute`.
.. py:class:: RBEISDistanceFunction(df, custom_map=None, threshold=None, weight=1.0)

   Callable object encapsulating one of the six RBEIS distance functions, its
   threshold value (where appropriate), any pairs of values to be overridden
   (for DFs 4-6), and a weight by which to scale its result.
   
   PLEASE NOTE that, in rbeis._calc_distances, the argument order is assumed to
   be (record, IGroup).  This is especially important when defining custom maps
   for DFs 4-6, which *do not* assume that f(x,y) == f(y,x).
