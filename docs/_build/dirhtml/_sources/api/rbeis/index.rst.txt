.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   
   RBEIS is a method originally developed for imputing categorical data in relatively small social surveys with the intention of minimising conditional imputation variance. It is derived from CANCEIS, which is better suited to large datasets such as the Census.  This implementation of RBEIS works with `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ DataFrames.

.. py:exception:: RBEISInputException

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`

   
   Exception raised in the case of faulty input to ``impute`` that is not covered by a TypeError.
.. py:exception:: RBEISInputWarning

   Bases: :py:obj:`UserWarning`

   
   Warning raised in the case of redundant input to ``impute``.
.. py:class:: RBEISDistanceFunction(df, custom_map=None, threshold=None, weight=1.0)

   
   Callable object encapsulating one of the six RBEIS distance functions, its threshold value (where appropriate), any pairs of values to be overridden (for DFs 4-6), and a weight by which to scale its result.
   
   RBEISDistanceFunctions have two public attributes: **f**, a two-argument function that computes the distance between two values, and **weight**, a numeric value by which the output of **f** is scaled (default value 1.0).
   
   * **df** (int): An integer from 1 to 6 corresponding to one of the standard RBEIS distance functions
   * **custom_map** (('a * 'a) * numeric dict): [Optional] A dictionary mapping pairs (2-tuples) of values to distances (value pair as key, distance as value), overriding the underlying standard distance function.  Note that ``(x,y)`` → ``z`` does **not** imply that ``(y,x)`` → ``z``.  This is required for distance functions 4, 5 and 6.
   * **threshold** (numeric): [Optional] A threshold value for distance functions 2, 3, 5 and 6.
   * **weight** (numeric): [Optional] A weight value by which to scale the output of the distance function.
   
   .. warning:: PLEASE NOTE that, when RBEIS calculates distances, the argument order is assumed to be (record, IGroup).  This is especially important when defining custom maps for DFs 4-6, which *do not* assume that ``f(x,y) == f(y,x)``.
   
   *Example usage:*
   
   .. code:: python
   
       myDF = RBEISDistanceFunction(6,
                                    custom_map = {(2, 3): 4, (8, 8): 0.25},
                                    threshold = 3,
                                    weight = 10)
       myDF(2, 2) # => 0
       myDF(2, 4) # => 5
       myDF(2, 8) # => 10
       myDF(2, 3) # => 40
       myDF(8, 8) # => 2.5
