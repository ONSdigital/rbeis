Rogers and Berriman Editing and Imputation System (RBEIS)
=========================================================

RBEIS is a method originally developed for imputing categorical data in relatively small social surveys with the intention of minimising conditional imputation variance. It is derived from CANCEIS, which is better suited to large datasets such as the Census.  This implementation of RBEIS works with `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ DataFrames.

When production ready, RBEIS will be distributed through PyPI.  To install, simply call ``pip install rbeis``.

Whilst still in the pre-release stage, the latest RBEIS wheel can be manually downloaded [from GitHub](https://github.com/y33les/rbeis/releases/latest).

RBEIS is licensed under the `MIT License <https://mit-license.org/>`_.
